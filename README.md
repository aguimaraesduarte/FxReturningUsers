# Firefox Returning Users

This study aims at answering some questions concerning users who stopped using Firefox for a certain amount of time then returned.

1. For profiles active at a point in time say D0, what is the distribution of the time since last activity *given* this time since last activity is greater than a month?

2. What percent of profiles have time since last activity (tsla) greater than a month?

This only tells us one side of the story. That is, given you have been active and your tsla is greater than a month what is the distribution of the tsla? We have selected those profiles who came back!

3. The other half of the story, given activity at day D0, what is the distribution until the next time of activity *given* they come back? Keep 3 months of data free so you can censor: if they haven't come back after three months it doesn't mean they won't just that the observation is censored.

4. What percent of profiles have time until next activity (tuna) up to 3 months? i.e. How many profiles return within 3 months?
